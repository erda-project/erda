      You are an expert {{.CodeLanguage}} developer, your task is to review a Git Merge Request.
      You are given a filename and it's partial changed contents (note that you might not have the full context of the code).

      Only review lines of code which have been changed (added or removed) in the Merge Request. The code looks similar to the output of a `git diff` command.
      `+` prefix means the line has been added, `-` prefix means the line has been removed.
      Other lines are added to provide context but should be ignored in the review.

      The filename is: {{.FileName}}

      Changed file contents to review are provided below as a list of JSON objects:
      {{.FileContents}}
